* Unit test application
This is the application for running LBGE unit tests.

To run unit tests, import `lbge-unittests` system via quicklisp, and
call `(lbge-unit-tests:run)`.

* Writing unit tests
This app collects all .lisp files from `t` subdirectories among the
whole engine, and loads its at runtime. For your file to be run, it
must also define a package for your unit tests, and the package name
must start with "lbge.test." prefix.

We use rove for unit testing, so use it for actually writing test
cases.

* An example:
~lbge/engine/math/t/vector.lisp:~
#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
  (defpackage :lbge.test.math-vector
    (:use :cl :rove :lbge.math))

  (in-package :lbge.test.math-vector)

  (deftest add-test
    (testing "2d vector addition"
             (ok (eq (add (make-float2 1 2)
                          (make-float2 3 4))
                     (make-float2 4 6))))

    (testing "3d vector addition"
             (ok (eq (add (make-float3 1 2 3)
                          (make-float3 4 5 6))
                     (make-float3 5 7 9))))

    (testing "4d vector addition"
             (ok (eq (add (make-float4 1 2 3 4)
                          (make-float4 5 6 7 8))
                     (make-float4 6 8 10 12)))))

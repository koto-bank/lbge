* LBGE - lisp butts game engine

Lisp game engine for creating Lisp-powered games.

** The name
The name "lbge" is case-insensitive, as it is customary in Common
Lisp, so you can write it any way you like.

** Some info
Lbge aims to be a very modular engine, with as less coupling as
possible. The only current really hard dependency is SDL2. The second
one (much less hard) is SBCL.

The ideal state would be a number of separate systems (in ASDF sense),
which will depend one on another, and can be used
separately. Considering this, lbge also can be though of as a platform
for engine development.

However, that ideal state is yet to be achieved, so currently there
are a number of systems that have shared files, e.g. ~lbge-render~ and
~lbge~ itself include a lot of files from ~math~ dir, and ~math~
itself doesn't have a system (yet).

** Repo structure
 * ~a/~ stands for "applications" and contain various systems that use
   lbge, such as test beds, tools, test runners etc.
 * ~src/~ contains source code
 * ~doc/~ currently doesn't contain documentation, but it certainly
   should (at some point). The only thing currently stored there is
   /ðŸ’žs e c r e tâœ¨/
 * ~/src/*/t~ contains tests, which are collected and executed by
   unit-tests application. More details [[./a/unit-tests/README.org][here]]
